# medical_ai_transcriber

Transcribe and create fancy reports from audio input & have a RAG system to retrieve data if needed.

Steps:
- Build simple RAG system
- Package it as a streamlit app
- Figure out how to take audio input -> make it text -> and give it to an LLM to analyse it and extract info
- Build a structure for a report (to be validated with Thomas co-founder)
